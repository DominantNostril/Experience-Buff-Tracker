# Experience Buff Tracker
Experience Buff Tracker is a custom pack for the [Guild Wars 2](https://guildwars2.com) addon [GW2 Reffect](https://github.com/Zerthox/gw2-reffect/) that makes it easy to track the game's various PvE experience buffs.

Icons for experience-modifying effects are displayed in single column that can be dragged anywhere on the screen. Buffs currently active on the character are displayed at full opacity, while missing and expired buffs are greyed-out to aid the player in determing what to reapply.
#

Killstreak, map-swap, seasonal, and zone-specific buffs are not included. See the wiki for a [complete list of experience modifiers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experience#Experience_modifiers). 

Some buffs' variants and different strengths are currently missing from the alpha release; for instance, only the full 25% Rested buff and 10% Guild XP Gain are shown. Most users will need to manually add the two *effect ID*s for whichever food and utility buffs they're using ([see this wiki page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:Projects/Nourishment_effect_ids) for those nourishment effect IDs).
