# Experience Buff Tracker
Experience Buff Tracker is a custom pack for the [Guild Wars 2](https://guildwars2.com) addon [GW2 Reffect](https://github.com/Zerthox/gw2-reffect/) that makes it easy to track the game's numerous PvE experience buffs.

Icons for common experience-modifying effects are displayed in a single column that can be dragged anywhere on the screen. Buffs currently active on the character are displayed at full opacity, while missing and expired buffs are greyed out to aid the player in determing what to apply.

Some uncommon buffs are completely hidden when inactive to reduce clutter, but will show if active. This includes Volunteer's Blessing (map swap) and Black Lion Boost. Their inactive-state icons may be enabled in the Reffect pack settings by changing their individual Thresholds to "Missing."

Killstreak, seasonal, and zone-specific buffs are not included. See the wiki for a [complete list of experience modifiers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experience#Experience_modifiers).

Most food and utility effects are currently missing, so users may need to manually add the two *effect ID*s for whichever nourishment they're using ([see this wiki page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:Projects/Nourishment_effect_ids) for nourishment effect IDs). Some other buffs' variants and lower strengths are not included in this release; for instance, only the maximum 10% Guild XP Gain is shown, while two of the lesser Homstead Rested buffs are missing.
