# Experience Buff Tracker
Experience Buff Tracker is a custom pack for the [Guild Wars 2](https://guildwars2.com) addon [GW2 Reffect](https://github.com/Zerthox/gw2-reffect/) that makes it easy to track the game's various experience buffs.

Icons for most of the possible experience-modifying effects are displayed in single column that can be placed anywhere on the screen. Buffs currently active on the character are displayed at full opacity, while missing buffs are greyed-out to aid the player in determing what to reapply.

Killstreak, map-swap, seasonal, and zone-specific buffs are not included. See the wiki for a [comlete list of experience modifiers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experience#Experience_modifiers). 

Buffs with different variations or strengths are currently missing from this alpha release; e.g., only the full 25% Rested buff and 10% Guild XP Gain are shown; while users will need to manually adjust the Food and Utility buffs to whichever ones they're using ([see this wiki page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:Projects/Nourishment_effect_ids) for those nourishment effect IDs).
