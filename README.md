# Experience Buff Tracker
Experience Buff Tracker is a custom pack for the [Guild Wars 2](https://guildwars2.com) addon [GW2 Reffect](https://github.com/Zerthox/gw2-reffect/) that makes it easy to track the game's various PvE experience buffs.

Icons for common experience-modifying effects are displayed in single column that can be dragged anywhere on the screen. Buffs currently active on the character are displayed at full opacity, while missing and expired buffs are greyed-out to aid the player in determing what to apply.

Killstreak, seasonal, and zone-specific buffs are not included. See the wiki for a [complete list of experience modifiers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experience#Experience_modifiers).

Uncommon buffs are hidden when inactive to reduce visual clutter, including Volunteer's Blessing (map swap) and Black Lion Boost. Their greyed-out inactive-state icons may be enabled in the Reffect pack settings by changing their individual Thresholds to "Missing."

Some buffs' variants and different strengths are not included in this alpha release; for instance, only the 10% Guild XP Gain is shown, while two of the Homstead Rested buffs are missing. Most users will need to manually add the two *effect ID*s for whichever food and utility buffs they're using ([see this wiki page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:Projects/Nourishment_effect_ids) for those nourishment effect IDs).
